        <p>
          Kiwi fruit is native to South-East China, where it grows in the wild.
          It was already mentioned in poems written in the 1st millennium BCE.
          It has been recorded as being cultivated from the 8th century BCE. It
          was first brought to France in the 1740s, but did not arouse any
          particular interest. In the late 19th century, kiwi fruit plants were
          introduced into Europe, then to the US, but the kiwi fruit remained a
          curiosity and only interested botanists because of its beautiful
          shape.

          New Zealand discovered this fruit in 1904 and would play a decisive
          role in distributing it. It was known as the ‘Chinese gooseberry’ at
          that time and, once it had acclimatised, it began to be cultivated.
          The first cases of fruit arrived in the United Kingdom in 1952. As it
          was difficult to promote ‘Chinese gooseberries’ in the US in the midst
          of the Cold War, the fruit was renamed kiwi fruit, after the New
          Zealand bird.

        <p>
          An intensive advertising campaign in 1974, helped market kiwi fruit
          throughout Europe. Although still an exotic and expensive fruit in the
          early 1980s, kiwi fruit became standard in the 1990s. Its high Vitamin
          C content was undoubtedly an added bonus to make it marketable.
          Following in New Zealand’s footsteps, many other countries began to
          cultivate it and have become major producers. Kiwi fruit has well and
          truly made itself at home throughout the world.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>

        <img src="הורדה.jpeg" alt="card img" class="card_img" />
        <p>
          Early varieties were described in a 1904 nursery catalogue as having
          "...edible fruits the size of walnuts, and the flavour of ripe
          gooseberries", leading to the name Chinese gooseberry.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <img src="הורדה (2).jpeg" alt="card img" class="card_img" />
        <p>
          Kiwifruit is native to central and eastern China. The first recorded
          description of the kiwifruit dates to 12th century China during the
          Song dynasty.

        <img src="הורדה (3).jpeg" alt="card img" class="card_img" />
        <p>
          The genus Actinidia comprises around 60 species. Their fruits are
          quite variable, although most are easily recognised as kiwifruit
          because of their appearance and shape.

        <h2>Fuzzy kiwifruit</h2>
        <img src="הורדה (4).jpeg" alt="card img" class="card_img" />
        <p>
          Most kiwifruit sold belongs to a few cultivars of A. deliciosa (fuzzy
          kiwifruit): 'Hayward', 'Blake' and 'Saanichton 12'. They have a fuzzy,
          dull brown skin and bright green flesh.

        <img src="הורדה (5).jpeg" alt="card img" class="card_img" />
        <p>
          Kiwi berries are edible fruits the size of a large grape, similar to
          fuzzy kiwifruit in taste and internal appearance but with a thin,
          smooth green skin. They are primarily produced by three species

        <h2>Actinidia chinensi</h2>
        <img src="images (1).jpeg" alt="card img" class="card_img" />
        <p>
          Actinidia chinensis (yellow kiwi or golden kiwifruit) has a smooth,
          bronze skin, with a beak shape at the stem attachment. Flesh colour
          varies from bright green to a clear, intense yellow

        <h2>Cultivation</h2>
        <img src="OIP (1).jpeg" alt="card img" class="card_img" />
        <p>
          Kiwifruit can be grown in most temperate climates with adequate summer
          heat. Where fuzzy kiwifruit (A. deliciosa) is not hardy, other species
          can be grown as substitutes.

        <h2>Breeding</h2>
        <img src="OIP.jpeg" alt="card img" class="card_img" />
        <p>
          Often in commercial farming, different breeds are used for rootstock,
          fruit bearing plants and pollinators. Therefore, the seeds produced
          are crossbreeds of their parents.
